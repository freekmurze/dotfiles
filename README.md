dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles. Also used by nearly all other geeks at [spatie.be](http://spatie.be) and [the amazing Frederick Vanbrabant](https://twitter.com/maybeFrederick/status/912620087538016257).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning the repository as '.dotfiles' in your homedirectory and running the bootstrap-script.

The bootstrap script can be run be cd-ing into the .dotfiles directory and performing this command:
```bash
./bootstrap
```


Feel free to create an issue on this repo if you have any questions about them.
