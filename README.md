# My personal dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Also used by nearly all other geeks at [spatie.be](http://spatie.be) and [the amazing Frederick Vanbrabant](https://twitter.com/maybeFrederick/status/912620087538016257).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions. Backups of settings are done via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:freekmurze/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

Feel free to create an issue on this repo if you have any questions about them.
